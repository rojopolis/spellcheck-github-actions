- Docker image updated to Python 3.10.4 slim via PR [#86](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/86) from @dependabot. [Release notes for Python 3.10.4](https://docs.python.org/release/3.10.4/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-10-4-final)

## 0.22.1, 2022-02-23, bug fix release, update recommended

- Testing the new Spanish support feature more thoroughly, demonstrated that the Docker build process was broken and only English worked
  
  - I addressed issue [#57](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/57), which demonstrated an issue with the Docker build, the issue is no longer relevant with the simplification of the Docker build via PR: [#82](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/82) by me (@jonasbn)

## 0.22.0, 2022-02-21, feature release, update not required

## 0.21.1, 2022-01-25, bug fix release, update required

- Release 0.21.0 was build and uploaded from the wrong architecture. This release addressed this issue ([#79](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/79)), thanks @chrispat for reporting

## 0.21.0, 2022-01-24, maintenance release, update not required

- Docker image updated to Python 3.10.2 slim via PR [#78](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/78) from @dependabot

## 0.20.0, 2021-12-21, bug fix release, update recommended

- Made the version specified in the `action.yml` follow the version indicated in the repository. Apparently we where pointing to `latest`, which is good _when_ and _if_ we are backwards compatible and yes we are still in _alpha_ expressed semantically by the version numbers starting with `0` as in `0.20.0`. This would however allow for us to release breaking changes, without breaking a lot of workflows, which would fetch the _latest_ Docker image, which can be either _unstable_ or a major release

## 0.19.0, 2021-12-18, security release, update recommended

- Requirement [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) updated from 4.6.3 to 4.6.5 via PR [#71](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/71) from @snyk-bot. This addresses a security, cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) library, see [SNYK-PYTHON-LXML-2316995](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-LXML-2316995)

From the [release notes for lxml 4.6.5](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/4.6.5/):

> A vulnerability (GHSL-2021-1038) in the HTML cleaner allowed sneaking script content through SVG images.
> A vulnerability (GHSL-2021-1037) in the HTML cleaner allowed sneaking script content through CSS imports and other crafted constructs.

- Docker image updated to Python 3.10.1 slim via PR [#70](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/70) from @dependabot

## 0.18.0, 2021-10-31 feature release, update not required

- This release introduces an enhancement or new feature if your will, implemented by @riccardoporreca via PR [#67](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/67). The enhancement takes advantage of the ability to [make annotations on actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-error-message), so you can from the action overview see an annotation indicating the error by the emitted error message from the action

## 0.17.0, 2021-10-14 maintenance release, update not required

- Docker image updated to Python 3.9.7 slim via PR [#62](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/62) and again to Python 3.10.0 slim via PR [#64](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/64) both from dependabot

## 0.16.0 2021-08-15 bug fix release, update recommended

Experienced an issue with the new multi-stage Docker build, where `aspell` _disappears_.

This release implements a _hack_ to make use that it is present, by reinstalling it :-/

REF: PR [#56](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/56) addressing issue [#55](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/55)

The issue in the Docker build is patched, but is still present, see issue [#57](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/57)

## 0.15.0 2021-08-15 maintenance release, update not required

WARNING! This release is not working, please use release 0.16.0

Issue [#53](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/53) describes an issue with ignoring Markdown regions with code fences. This was an issue in `pyspelling`, which is the core component in this action. Luckily @facelessuser, the maintainer of `pyspelling` was to [fix it](https://github.com/facelessuser/pyspelling/pull/144). So the requirement for `pyspelling` was bumped from 2.6.1 to 2.7.3

Thanks to @supernovae and @facelessuser

This is experimental and will need further investigation. Aspell support 53 different dictionaries and supporting them all increases the Docker image size significantly so dynamic loading of dictionaries has to be investigated further, without increasing build time to a point where a pre-built Docker image is not longer feasible

- The action now uses a DockerHub served image, which mean that the Docker image does not have to be built at every invocation
