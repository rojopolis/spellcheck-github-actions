## 0.44.0, 2024-10-25, maintenance release, update not required

- Docker image updated to Python 3.13.0 slim via PR [#217](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/217) from Dependabot. [Release notes for Python 3.13.0](https://docs.python.org/release/3.13.0/whatsnew/changelog.html)

- Since lxml was not building I bumped to the latest release 5.3.0. In in relation to that, so I while I was at it I went through the dependencies and updated the ones possible using a PySpelling build as the baseline. The following dependencies were updated:

- beautifulsoup4 bumped from version 4.12.2 to 4.12.3, see [release notes](https://git.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/tree/CHANGELOG)
- lxml bumped from version 4.9.3 to 5.3.0, see [release notes](https://github.com/lxml/lxml/blob/master/CHANGES.txt)
- Markdown bumped from version 3.4.4 to 3.7, see [release notes](https://python-markdown.github.io/changelog/#37-2024-08-16)
- pymdown-extensions bumped from version 10.4 to 10.11.2, see [release notes](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/releases/tag/10.11.2)
- PyYAML bumped from version 6.0.1 to 6.0.2, see [release notes](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/blob/main/CHANGES)
- soupsieve bumped from version 2.5 to 2.6, see [release notes](https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve/releases/tag/2.6)

## 0.43.1, 2024-10-17, bug fix release, update recommended

- This is an attempt at addressing the conflict between using the PySpelling `--source` parameter and the `sources` parameter in the PySpelling configuration file introduced by this action. With the recommendation of using the GitHub Action: [tj-actions/changed-files](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/changed-files), the use of the `--source` flag was adopted, but this bypasses the filtering mechanism, which can be enabled in the configuration file. The update recommendation is due to the fact that you might experience unwanted behaviour if your `sources` contain negated file patterns. The patch enables application of the configured filter to the source parameters, so the action can be used with the `--source` parameter and the `sources` configuration parameter in combination.

- Minor error in the previous release, re-releasing as `0.40.0` see changes from `0.39.0` below

## 0.39.0, 2024-07-17, maintenance release, update recommended

- PR from @snyk-bot [#204](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/204) this updates the indirect Python dependency `zipp` from version `3.15.0` to `3.19.1`
  The dependency has a security flaw, please see below references.

  Do note `zipp` is not a direct dependency, but it is a dependency of `importlib-metadata`, which is a dependency of `pyspelling`, which is the core component of this action.

  By indicating is as a direct dependency of version 3.19.1, we can ensure that the action is not vulnerable, even though the vulnerability might not directly exploitable in the context of this action.

Bumping to Python 3.12.0 slim, introduced a number of dependency updates, not all were required, but I have decided to update quite a few, since the Docker image is rebuilt anyway.

- Bumped the core component PySpelling to version 2.9, together with wcmatch, bumped to version 2.5, all via PR [#174](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/170) bu @jonasbn

- Docker image updated to Python 3.11.5 slim via PR [#170](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/170) from Snyk. [Release notes for Python 3.11.5](https://docs.python.org/release/3.11.5/whatsnew/changelog.html)

- Added constraint for `requirements.txt` since one of the dependencies does not support Cython version 3.

I found two guides to fixing the problem:

- ["Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully for sap aicore"](https://answers.sap.com/questions/13931156/getting-requirements-to-build-wheel-did-not-run-su.html)
- ["Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully exit code: 1"](https://discuss.python.org/t/getting-requirements-to-build-wheel-did-not-run-successfully-exit-code-1/30365)

They state somewhat the same and I have applied a fix via PR [#172](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/172) now the Docker image can build again

## 0.33.1, 2023-07-13, bug fix release, update not required

- An update is recommended if you are using the `output_file` parameter, since the output file handling was shielding the propagation of the status of the actual spellcheck.

  The issue was observed in [#166](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/166) reported by @nlhomme, where the action was reporting success, even though the spellcheck was failing.

  The bug information was lifted into a new issue [#167](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/167) and was addressed in PR [#168](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/168) by @jonasbn

## 0.33.0, 2023-06-16, maintenance release, update not required

- Docker image updated to Python 3.11.4 slim via PR [#164](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/164) from Snyk. [Release notes for Python 3.11.4](https://docs.python.org/release/3.11.4/whatsnew/changelog.html)

## 0.32.0, 2023-05-18, security patch release, update recommended

- @dependabot raised [an alert](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/security/dependabot/3) for the used dependency: [pymdown-extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions). The vulnerability is labelled as [CVE-2023-32309](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32309). The issue has been present in [pymdown-extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions) since version [1.5.0](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/releases/tag/1.5.0) and is patched in version [10.0](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/releases/tag/10.0).

- Snyk has provided a patch via PR [#158](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/158), which has been tested and no regressions has been observed, even with a version leap for [pymdown-extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions). from version [8.2](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/releases/tag/8.2) to [10.0](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/releases/tag/10.0). The GitHub Action has been updated to use the patched version, even though there are no direct use of the vulnerable code in the action, but we do not want to be the source of a vulnerability.

- [pymdown-extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions) was increased to version [10.0.1](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/releases/tag/10.0.1), since a bug fix was released to follow up on the security patch.

## 0.30.0, 2023-02-20, maintenance release, update not required

- PySpelling updated from version 2.8.1 to 2.8.2, including several fixes
  - FIX: Ensure that Aspell actually uses the encoding passed to it for dictionaries.
  - FIX: Use a disallow list for problematic or unsupported arguments to the underlying spell checker instead of using a more restrictive allow list.

- [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) bumped to version 4.9.1 from 4.9.1 to get the build to work, without jumping through too many hoops. We prefer relying on wheel instead of building from source, since `lxml` can become quite a time sink

## 0.28.0, 2022-11-16, maintenance release, update not required

- Docker image updated to Python 3.10.8 slim via PR [#129](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/129) from @snyk-bot. [Release notes for Python 3.10.8](https://docs.python.org/release/3.10.8/whatsnew/changelog.html)

## 0.24.0, 2022-05-17, feature release, update not required

- @riccardoporreca created issue [#68](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/68) requested the ability to create an output artifact.

  With release 0.24.0 this is now available.

  The action configuration has to have the `output_file` parameter specified, which is a new optional parameter.

  ```yaml
  name: Spellcheck Action

  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    push:

  jobs:
    build:
      name: Spellcheck
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions@0.24.0
        name: Spellcheck (no output file)
        with:
          source_files: README.md CHANGELOG.md

      - uses: rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions@0.24.0
        name: Spellcheck (with output file)
        with:
          source_files: README.md CHANGELOG.md
          task_name: Markdown
          output_file: spellcheck-output.txt

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        name: Archive spellcheck output output
        with:
          name: Spellcheck artifact
          path: spellcheck-output.txt
  ```

  This introduces the use of the `upload-artifact@v3` action.

  The generated artifact can be downloaded via GitHub UI/API, please consult the documentation for details and pointers.

  Thanks to @riccardoporreca for his suggestion.

## 0.22.1, 2022-02-23, bug fix release, update recommended

- Testing the new Spanish support feature more thoroughly, demonstrated that the Docker build process was broken and only English worked

  - I addressed issue [#57](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/57), which demonstrated an issue with the Docker build, the issue is no longer relevant with the simplification of the Docker build via PR: [#82](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/82) by me (@jonasbn)

## 0.22.0, 2022-02-21, feature release, update not required

## 0.20.0, 2021-12-21, bug fix release, update recommended

- Made the version specified in the `action.yml` follow the version indicated in the repository. Apparently we where pointing to `latest`, which is good _when_ and _if_ we are backwards compatible and yes we are still in _alpha_ expressed semantically by the version numbers starting with `0` as in `0.20.0`. This would however allow for us to release breaking changes, without breaking a lot of workflows, which would fetch the _latest_ Docker image, which can be either _unstable_ or a major release

## 0.19.0, 2021-12-18, security release, update recommended

- Requirement [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) updated from 4.6.3 to 4.6.5 via PR [#71](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/71) from @snyk-bot. This addresses a security, cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in the [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) library, see [SNYK-PYTHON-LXML-2316995](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-LXML-2316995)

From the [release notes for lxml 4.6.5](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/4.6.5/):

> A vulnerability (GHSL-2021-1038) in the HTML cleaner allowed sneaking script content through SVG images.
> A vulnerability (GHSL-2021-1037) in the HTML cleaner allowed sneaking script content through CSS imports and other crafted constructs.

- Docker image updated to Python 3.10.1 slim via PR [#70](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/70) from @dependabot

## 0.18.0, 2021-10-31 feature release, update not required

- This release introduces an enhancement or new feature if your will, implemented by @riccardoporreca via PR [#67](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/67). The enhancement takes advantage of the ability to [make annotations on actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-error-message), so you can from the action overview see an annotation indicating the error by the emitted error message from the action

## 0.17.0, 2021-10-14 maintenance release, update not required

- Docker image updated to Python 3.9.7 slim via PR [#62](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/62) and again to Python 3.10.0 slim via PR [#64](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/64) both from dependabot

## 0.16.0 2021-08-15 bug fix release, update recommended

Experienced an issue with the new multi-stage Docker build, where `aspell` _disappears_.

This release implements a _hack_ to make use that it is present, by reinstalling it :-/

REF: PR [#56](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/56) addressing issue [#55](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/55)

The issue in the Docker build is patched, but is still present, see issue [#57](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/57)

## 0.15.0 2021-08-15 maintenance release, update not required

WARNING! This release is not working, please use release 0.16.0

Issue [#53](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/53) describes an issue with ignoring Markdown regions with code fences. This was an issue in `pyspelling`, which is the core component in this action. Luckily @facelessuser, the maintainer of `pyspelling` was to [fix it](https://github.com/facelessuser/pyspelling/pull/144). So the requirement for `pyspelling` was bumped from 2.6.1 to 2.7.3

Thanks to @supernovae and @facelessuser

- Added support for German spelling: `lang: de`, including: Swiss and Austrian dictionaries addressing issue [#35](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/issues/35) via PR [#36](https://github.com/rojopolis/spellcheck-github-actions/pull/36).
